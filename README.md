# vn.js
vn.js is both a visual novel player and engine

## Todo
Better documentation :P

## Testing
1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mkgiga/vn.js
```
2. Serve the HTML file `/test/index.html` using something like VS Code's [Live Preview]("https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server") or similar and open it in your browser.
